# SARate

SARate is a library to get positive app reviews on the AppStore.  SARate is a subclass of  [iRate](https://github.com/nicklockwood/iRate). This repo is a fork from [The Original SARate](https://github.com/andrei200287/SARate). This library has been very useful for me but unfortunately the original repo is inactive and not carthage compatible.
